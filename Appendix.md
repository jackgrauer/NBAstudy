# Appendix C

## Tax Policy and City Characteristics

This section provides an overview of tax policies and characteristics of various cities. It indicates whether the city has NBA revenue, wage tax, and sales tax. These values defined whether each given city was either designated as a control group or a treatment group in each model, or excluded.

## Appendix D: Parallel Trends Assumption Tests

### Sales Tax Trends

We analyzed the slope trends of sales tax for cities with and without NBA teams. The negative slope indicates a general decrease in sales tax revenue over time for both groups of cities.

- **Slope of Sales Tax Trend:**
  - NBA cities: -4.026925068526744e-05
  - Non-NBA cities: -2.0936099088053373e-05

To determine if the trends in sales tax revenue for NBA and non-NBA cities are parallel, a t-test was conducted.

- **T-test for Parallel Trends (Sales Tax):**
  - T-statistic: -15.411849395399376
  - P-value: 1.364958997896191e-14
  - Degrees of freedom: 26.0

The significant p-value indicates that the difference in slopes between NBA and non-NBA cities is statistically significant.

### Wage Tax Trends

Similarly, the wage tax trends were analyzed. The slopes for NBA and non-NBA cities show different trends, with non-NBA cities having a positive slope, indicating an increase in wage tax revenue over time.

- **Slope of Wage Tax Trend:**
  - NBA cities: -6.61648190158625e-06
  - Non-NBA cities: 7.384962966335062e-05

A t-test was also conducted to compare the wage tax trends between NBA and non-NBA cities.

- **T-test for Parallel Trends (Wage Tax):**
  - T-statistic: -42.86788390451699
  - P-value: 1.183069977160952e-25
  - Degrees of freedom: 26.0

The significant p-value suggests a substantial difference in wage tax trends of NBA and non-NBA cities.

### Analysis of Slope Differences

The analysis further explored the differences in slopes for sales and wage taxes.

#### Sales Tax Slope Difference

- **Slope Difference (Sales Tax):**
  - Difference: -1.933315159721407e-05
  - T-statistic: -0.9281909617845188
  - P-value: 0.3533085219378411

The non-significant p-value indicates that the difference in the decline rates of sales tax revenue between NBA and non-NBA cities is not statistically significant.

#### Wage Tax Slope Difference

- **Slope Difference (Wage Tax):**
  - Difference: -8.046611156493688e-05
  - T-statistic: -0.9281909617845228
  - P-value: 0.35330852193783935

Similarly, the difference in wage tax revenue trends between the two groups is not statistically significant.

## Statistical Analysis Summary

### Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for Sales Tax Model

The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) assesses the level of multicollinearity in the regression model. High VIF values indicate high correlation among predictors.

| Feature             | VIF        |
|---------------------|------------|
| **const**           | 3.555556   |
| **NBA_Team**        | 1.066667   |
| **Post_2016**       | 3.333333   |
| **Interaction_2016**| 3.400000   |

### Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality (Sales Tax)

The Shapiro-Wilk test checks for the normality of residuals. A significant p-value indicates deviation from normality.

- **P-value**: 8.707994336210438e-12

### Breusch-Pagan Test for Heteroscedasticity (Sales Tax)

The Breusch-Pagan test detects heteroscedasticity in the residuals. A significant p-value suggests heteroscedasticity.

- **P-value**: 0.8069783340990326

### Durbin-Watson Test for Autocorrelation (Sales Tax)

The Durbin-Watson test assesses autocorrelation in residuals. A value close to 2 indicates no autocorrelation.

- **Statistic**: 1.616710947262373
