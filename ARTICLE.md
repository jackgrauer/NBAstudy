# Does NBA Revenue Matter to Local Governments? 

Abstract: This study tested the relationship between wage tax revenue in mid-sized U.S. cities like Philadelphia that host professional basketball teams, and NBA revenue fluctuations. Results indicate NBA revenue increases do not spill over to tax revenue gains in Philadelphia, and NBA player payrolls do not significantly impact city wage tax in the cities observed.

Developers associated with the Philadelphia 76ers want to build a new basketball arena near the city’s downtown Chinatown. City Council has yet to definitively block or approve the project but will likely make a final decision some time in 2024.

The proposed new arena would border the major cultural center of Chinatown to the north. Some stakeholders argue that a new basketball arena in the area would cannibalize restaurant revenue—a central industry in the neighborhood—and increase the cost of living, putting additional pressure on residents. To the proposed stadium’s south, workers at a major hospital and a fire station would be forced to compete with sports fans for traffic infrastructure and road space (Hunt).  

Developers must persuade policy makers that benefits like new jobs, increased foot traffic, and new tax revenue for local and state governments outweigh all potential risks. They projected the arena would produce $800 million in tax revenue for Philadelphia General Fund and $200 million for the School District over the course of 29 years: $74.7 million in personal income tax, $248.9 million in sales and use tax, $118.8 million in corporate net income tax, $28.8 million in liquor tax, and $800,000 in realty transfer tax (76DevCo). 

The argument rests on the assumption that a policy decision expected to financially benefit an NBA franchise will produce a clear financial benefit to the city that hosts that frnachise. To test this assumptoin, tThis study looks to the NBA's last major financial victory for evidence that it financially benefitted professional basketball team host cities.

The 2016 NBA media distribution deal with Turner and ESPN, which significantly increased NBA franchise revenue and layer payrolls nationwide, provided a natural experiment to this end.

Prior research has shown that a media distribution deal between the NBA and Turner-ESPN, which took effect in 2016, corresponded to NBA revenue and payroll increases (Keefer 2021). The current study will show that the deal indeed produced despite the measurable gains to the NBA, but NBA team hosting cities did not see more noticeably more tax revenue gains in subsequent years than cities that do not host NBA teams.

The exploratory stage of the test made a case study of Philadelphia. A second and more rigorously controlled and calculated survey expanded the test across 17 cities with and without a sales and wage tax systems, and that do and do not host NBA teams. The more , main study produced results consistent with the Philadelphia findings: the large and sudden revenue influx of revenue to the NBA in 2016 did not correlate to noticeable in municipal government sales or wage tax revenues.

A consultant hired to assess the economic benefits the 76ers provided for Philadelphia found the 76ers generated about $6.9 million a year in annual tax revenue for Philadelphia in the 1980s. Economists have since used Shils’ work as a teachable example of techniques frequently employed with the intention to overestimate the economic impacts of such development projects (Cromley, Baade).  

Philadelphia’s Commerce Department estimated the Spectrum contributed $6.2 million in tax revenue and generated $8.8 million for the City in a newly constructed 76ers venue (Shropshire and Kelly, p. 21). City Council rapidly approved the construction of Spectrum II, now known as the Wells Fargo Center, after the 76ers threatened to leave the City in 1991. When the private financing negotiations behind the new construction project stumbled, an Inquirer op-ed expanded the promised municipal tax revenue figure $12 million (Macnow, Daughen, Anonymous).  

The 76ers played the first season in their current home venue, 3601 S Broad St., in 1996. Ultimately, Philadelphia contributed $8 million in grants and $9.3 million in discounts from the project, which cost $223 million (Frank et al., p. 388). 

To test whether the 76ers and their home venue met predictions, we requested relevant documents from the City of Philadelphia. The Law Department found no responsive records to a request for the lease agreement between Wells Fargo Center’s and the City and the Center’s annual financial statements.  

The lease document, available on file at the Department of Records, indicated developers and the property management company, Spectrum Arena Partners, LP, paid no realty transfer tax and (lease p. 44, 78, 388). A document in Bessey V. Spectrum Arena, filed by Spectrum Arena’s attorney in US Federal Court, confirmed Spectrum pays no parking tax, and a fixed $2 million annual payment-in-lieu-of-taxes in place of property tax. The 76ers and their property management company, according to the court documents, does pay other taxes typical to a company operating in City limits: Wage, Business Privilege Tax, Sales, Amusement, and Net Profits Taxes. 

In the exploratory phase of this study, we estimated the 76ers’ municipal tax revenue contributions to Philadelphia between 2001 and 2022, using Forbes financial data on the team, and consolidated annual financial reports from the City. The Methodology section discusses the dataset in greater data. We looked at Philadelphia tax revenue and used tax rate data to calculate the 76ers’ estimated tax contributions: an basic, uncontrolled limited in scope to Philadelphia.

If these estimates proved at all accurate, 76ers player payrolls markedly increased in 2016. The pandemic hampered them briefly and picked up where they left off afterward. Tax revenues in Philadelphia, magnitudes larger in scale, registered no noticeable change that year.

The 2016 NBA-Turner-ESPN deal accounted for this change in the 76ers’ contributions. A broadcasting agreement between the NBA, Turner, and ESPN took effect that year. The deal represented an estimated $24 billion, superseding the NBA’s prior $2.67 billion deal. The media deal produced a historically significant NBA revenue influx.  

Sports economists have used team relocations, venue construction, and lockouts and strikes as natural experiments to this effect, but the last major 2011 NBA stoppage resulted in only 11 un-played NBA home games over the course of 161-days. League-wide, the partial loss of a single season represented hundreds of millions of dollars due to a lockout by team management over a contract dispute. Locally, the Philadelphia City Controller’s Office estimated potential tax revenue losses at only around $90,000 per game (Gambacorta). 

## LITERATURE REVIEW 
Majority academic concensus holds that consensus public investment in sports mostly produces losses, and occasionally neutral results or slim gains (Bradbury et al., 2023, p. 2). The few voices of dissent have generally held that the public benefits of professional sports may only be quantified in extra-financial metrics like civic pride and personal inspiration, and have favored qualitative methodologies like phone surveys over quantitative assessments.

Bradbury et al. has recently and diligently catalogued the recent, the larger history of work on the economic effects of all professional sports leagues over the last several decades. The current review focused more narrowly on NBA teams and stadiums and the tax revenue local governments collect from them.  

The contributions of professional basketball to tax revenue, observable at the state level, represent fractions of those from professional football and baseball (Belleville). The most granular end of the research has differentiated between individual NBA games, and game types: playoff, regular season, home, away. NBA playoff games generated positive revenue, versus regular home and away games, which produced net revenue losses (Baade, Baumann, and Matheson, 2008, p. 800). 

Other studies examined economic fluctuations in local government tax revenue before and after NBA team relocations. Dean et al. tested for sales tax revenue fluctuations during Oklahoma City’s transition from hosting no professional sports teams to hosting one NBA team. After Oklahoma City raised the sales tax rate to fund the construction of an NBA arena, sales tax revenue increased only slightly in subsequent years (2017, p. 8). 

Propheter (2012) found no proof of economic development following the construction of any NBA arenas between 1994 and 2009 (p. 450). In a senior thesis, Gilchrist expanded and updated Propheter’s work to include more cities, updated the data through 2018, and considered additional variables like franchise value and team success. The thesis documented no evidence of economic development in cities with newly built NBA venues when controlling for exterior factors.  

Most prior tests for impact on city tax revenue by professional sports have focused solely on sales tax, overlooking the small group of US cities that heavily rely on wage taxes like Philadelphia. Philadelphia charges the country’s highest wage tax rate. Wage tax revenue is currently the city’s single largest tax revenue source (City of Philadelphia). 76ers power forward Joel Embiid alone owed Philadelphia more in wage tax than all professional basketball spectators combined paid in amusement tax in 2020 (Sportrac). 

Despite this trend to focus primarily on sales tax revenue in these scenarios, several arguments in recent public policy literature make the case for including wage tax.

Wage tax revenue may say more about a city’s fiscal health than sales tax per dollar, though it generally represents smaller proportions of cities’ overall revenue bases. Guzman and Ermasova, weighed wage tax as a more significant indicator of municipal fiscal health than sales tax revenue (2022). Wage tax tracks more closely to important metrics like per capita income and employment (Bruce, Fox, & Tuttle, 2006). 

## METHODOLOGY  

In the exploratory phase of this study, we estimated the 76ers’ total tax contributions to Philadelphia since 2001. We listed known taxes through which local government receives revenue from NBA operations: amusement, business, net profits, wage, and sales taxes. Spectrum makes a $2 million annual Payment in Lieu of Taxes in place of property tax to Philadelphia. 

Annual Philadelphia tax rate data was used to estimate how much the 76ers owed in each of these tax categories between 2001 and 2022. We excluded gate receipts data because it was missing for some years. Given Zimbalist’s estimate that 1/3 of NBA players live in the cities that host their teams, we estimated that Philadelphia charged 1/3 of 76ers resident wage tax rate and non-resident wage rate to the rest. Here are the detailed calculations for each estimate:

#### 1. Amusement Tax Contribution
- **Metric**: 76ers' Gate Receipts
- **Tax Rate**: Amusement Tax Rate
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Amusement Tax Contribution} = \text{Gate Receipts} \times \text{Amusement Tax Rate}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{Year 2001: } \$21,680,000 \times 0.05 = \$1,084,000
  \]

#### 2. Business Income and Receipts Tax (BIRT) Contributions

**Gross Receipts Contribution**:
- **Metric**: 76ers' Revenue
- **Tax Rate**: BIRT Gross Receipts Rate
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Gross Receipts Contribution} = \text{Revenue} \times \text{BIRT Gross Receipts Rate}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{Year 2001: } \$106,000,000 \times 0.002525 = \$267,650
  \]

**Net Income Contribution**:
- **Metric**: 76ers' Operating Income
- **Tax Rate**: BIRT Net Income Rate
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Net Income Contribution} = \text{Operating Income} \times \text{BIRT Net Income Rate}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{Year 2001: } \$18,100,000 \times 0.065 = \$1,176,500
  \]

#### 3. Wage Tax Contributions

**Resident Contribution**:
- **Metric**: 76ers' Player Expenses (one-third allocated to residents)
- **Tax Rate**: Wage Tax Rate Resident
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Resident Wage Tax Contribution} = \text{Player Expenses} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Wage Tax Rate Resident}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{Year 2001: } \$53,000,000 \times \frac{1}{3} \times 0.045385 = \$801,801
  \]

**Non-Resident Contribution**:
- **Metric**: 76ers' Player Expenses (two-thirds allocated to non-residents)
- **Tax Rate**: Wage Tax Rate Non-Resident
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Non-Resident Wage Tax Contribution} = \text{Player Expenses} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Wage Tax Rate Non-Resident}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{Year 2001: } \$53,000,000 \times \frac{2}{3} \times 0.043125 = \$1,523,749
  \]

#### 4. Sales Tax Contribution
- **Metric**: 76ers' Revenue
- **Tax Rate**: Sales Tax Rate
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Sales Tax Contribution} = \text{Revenue} \times \text{Sales Tax Rate}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{Year 2001: } \$106,000,000 \times 0.01 = \$1,060,000
  \]

#### 5. Net Profits Tax Contribution
- **Metric**: 76ers' Operating Income
- **Tax Rate**: Net Profit Tax Rate Resident
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Net Profits Tax Contribution} = \text{Operating Income} \times \text{Net Profit Tax Rate Resident}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{Year 2001: } \$18,100,000 \times 0.045385 = \$821,468
  \]

#### 6. Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)
- **Fixed amount per year**: \$2,000,000

#### 7. Total Revenue Per Year
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Sum of All Contributions}
  \]
- **Example for Year 2001**:
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = \$1,084,000 + \$267,650 + \$1,176,500 + \$801,801 + \$1,523,749 + \$1,060,000 + \$821,468 + \$2,000,000 = \$8,735,168
  \]

The observed 2015-2016 NBA revenue influx coincided with the termination of a collective bargaining contract between NBAs and team management, which raised the soft salary cap for NBA players 35%: a historically significant amount. NBA free agent player salaries increased 81% during 2016 (Keefer 2021, p. 3475). Economist Quinn Keefer used these events to test whether better player compensation produced better on-court performance. From an public administration perspective, these events also created a natural experiment test whether NBA teams’ finances efffect their home cities' tax revenue bases.

Since these league-level event gains produced a major, positive impact to the 76ers' finances, but no noticeable gains to Philadelphia's tax revenue base, we predicted a similar situation across other NBA teams and other NBA host cities: the NBA's 2016 would translate to revenue increases for NBA teams, but would not translate to local tax revenue gains for NBA-team host cities.

## Main Study

We tested this prediction on 17 mid-sized US cities between 2001 and 2002. The study excluded major US population centers like New York and Chicago. These larger US cities' tax bases were too large compared to the size of their basketball teams for us to observe the effects we wanted to observe. We also eliminated Oklahoma City due to a team relocation during the observation period. 

City wage and sales tax revenue data came from each respective city’s consolidated annual financial reports, NBA financial data from Forbes and Statista, historical city population estimates from the US Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program, and macroeconomic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 

Data pre-processing consisted of five steps. To create control and treatment groups, we flagged cities by the presence or absence of wage and sales tax systems and the presence or absence of NBA franchises. This enabled us to test for a difference in tax revenue increases in cities during 2016 that host NBA teams versus non-NBA teams hosting cities. To control for COVID 19's effects, we smoothed financial data from 2020 and 2021 by averaging those values with unaffected values from neighboring years. To control for inflation, we converted financial data from all years to 2020 values with adjustment factors based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To control for population differences by city and by years, we normalized financial data on an annual, per capita basis.

To test whether a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis would work in this scenario, we needed to test for parallel trends between aggregated wage and sales tax revenue prior to 2016. We ran a preliminary Origin of Least Squares (OLS) regression to find lines of best fit for those variables. We then calculated and compared the slopes of those lines. 

Diagnostics on the preliminary OLS regression also guided model selection. Heteroscedascity and non-normality warnings, both common in panel data analyses, informed the decision to use a Weighted Least Squares (WLS) regression with robust (HC3) standard errors. 

We set up a multivariate regression that ran two models. The first model assessed the 2016 media deal's impact on sales tax revenue. The second did the same for wage tax revenue. For each of these two models, cities were divided into groups based on several presence or absence of an NBA team, and the presence or absence of wage and sales systems. 

Wage Tax Model:

$
\text{WageTax}_{it} = \beta_{0,1} + \beta_{1,1} \text{NBA Team}_i + \beta_{2,1} \text{Post-2016}_t + \beta_{3,1} (\text{NBA Team}_i \times \text{Post-2016}_t) + \epsilon_{it,1}
$

Sales Tax Model:

$
\text{SalesTax}_{it} = \beta_{0,2} + \beta_{1,2} \text{NBA Team}_i + \beta_{2,2} \text{Post-2016}_t + \beta_{3,2} (\text{NBA Team}_i \times \text{Post-2016}_t) + \epsilon_{it,2}
$

Where:

$\text{WageTax}_{it}$ represents the wage tax revenue in given city $i$ at time $t$.

$\text{SalesTax}_{it}$ represents the sales tax revenue in given city $i$ at time $t$.

$\beta_{0,1}$ and $\beta_{0,2}$ are the intercepts for the wage tax and sales tax models.

$\beta_{1,1}$ and $\beta_{1,2}$ are the coefficients for the presence of an NBA team in the wage tax and sales tax models.

$\beta_{2,1}$ and $\beta_{2,2}$ are the coefficients for the post-2016 period in the wage tax and sales tax models.

$\beta_{3,1}$ and $\beta_{3,2}$ are the interaction terms capturing the effect of the 2016 media deal on cities with NBA teams for the wage tax and sales tax models.

$\epsilon_{it,1}$ and $\epsilon_{it,2}$ are the error terms for the wage tax and sales tax models.

The first model designated cities with an NBA team and a sales tax system as the treatment group. Cities with no NBA and a sales tax were designated as the control group. The second model the similar, except treatment and control groups were defined based on the presence or absence of a wage tax system. This configuration enabled us to assess whether cities with NBA teams saw sales tax revenue increases in tandem with the major revenue increases the NBA experienced in 2016.

In both models, we represented the 2016 intervention with the variable ‘Post-2016,’ which divided observations by whether they were made before the 2016 intervention and after it. This term captured differences in tax revenue impacts in cities with NBA teams before and after the 2016 media deal. The interaction term ‘NBA Team * Post-2016’ isolated the effect of the media deal to any potential difference of impact on cities with and without NBA teams.

Given the early diagnostic warnings the preliminary data analysis produced, we performed several post-modelling tests to assess the severity of multicollinearity, and heteroscedascity in the WLS models. To test whether non-normality of data threatened the strength of our hypotheses, we re-tested them with stationary bootstrapping.

## RESULTS 

The exploratory section of this study compared tax revenue collected by the City of Philadelphia and informed estimates of what the 76ers and their property management company owed Philadelphia in taxes from 2001 to 2002. On Philadelphia's side, we identified the three line items to which the 76ers' operation contributed: Business Privelige, Wage and Earnings, and Sales and Use Taxes. 

On the 76ers' side, we matched each available financial metric available on the team to an appropriate per year percentage charged in Philadelphia tax. For example, we estimated Amusement Tax generated by the 76ers for Philadelphia by taking 76ers' gate receipt revenue for each year and applying the percentage charged in amsent tax that year.

Philadelphia’s three major tax revenue streams over 20 years showed no obvious fluctuations other than a pandemic-adjacent dip in wage tax revenue. 76ers tax contributions to Philadelphia remained mostly static until 2015, and showed a subsequent upward turn, temporarily stifled by the pandemic.

The findings, aligned with the existing research, suggested financial performance of NBA teams had little influence on tax revenue in host cities.




## LIMITATIONS 

...NBA teams host numerous games that attract large crowds. This can directly increase local economic activity through spending on tickets, concessions, merchandise, parking, and other game-related expenses. 

Indirect and Induced Impacts: The presence of NBA teams can also indirectly boost local businesses, such as bars, restaurants, and hotels, as fans often spend money in these establishments before and after games. Additionally, these businesses may hire more employees or increase hours to accommodate game-day crowds, further stimulating local economies. 

Enhanced City Visibility and Branding: Hosting an NBA team puts cities on a national or even international stage, potentially attracting more tourists, business investments, and enhancing the city's brand as a vibrant, lively place to visit or live. 

## Limitations of the Proxy: 

Oversimplification of Economic Contributions: While the presence of an NBA team is indicative of certain types of economic activities, it might oversimplify or overlook other economic dynamics. For instance, the actual economic impact of an NBA team can be far less than expected if most of the money spent on and around game days comes from local residents (substitution effect), meaning it merely redistributes money that might have been spent on other local entertainment options. 

Neglecting Non-Economic Factors: The proxy does not account for non-economic factors that might influence economic activities, such as cultural shifts, changes in consumer preferences, or broader economic downturns or booms that affect overall spending patterns regardless of the presence of an NBA team. 

Ignoring Negative Impacts: The presence of an NBA team can also have potential downsides, such as increased congestion, higher public safety costs on game days, and significant public expenditure on stadium subsidies and infrastructure improvements, which might not result in a net economic benefit. These aspects are not captured merely by the presence of a team. 

Heterogeneity Among Cities: The economic influence of NBA teams might vary significantly from one city to another based on a range of factors such as team popularity, the size of the metropolitan area, and the local economic structure. The proxy assumes a uniform impact across all cities, which is an oversimplification. 

Further research would benefit from better access to primary source financial documents and would include more granular monthly data. It would also benefit from data on all types of taxes cities exact from the NBA in addition to wage tax, such as net profits and sales tax.   

Philadelphia has denied most requests for public access to transaction records between Wells Fargo Center and the city with information in question in this study, among many others related to the stadium proposal (Althouse). Without access to documents needed to directly assess the predictions, this study relied on annual, city-level financial data. Accounting conventions varied between cities; fiscal years begin and end in different months. An analysis of monthly data would further articulate the nuances of the 2016 intervention and improve control of actuarial variances. 

##insert thing about how we're talking about what the EDAF may have owed, not what they actually paid, since we're not looking at primary source documentation.

## CONCLUSION 

The 2016 NBA-Turner-ESPN media produced league-level revenue gains, and increased NBA players’ payrolls by a substantial margin. These payroll increases did not further translate to substantial local tax revenue through the conduit of wage tax in any city observed in this study.
