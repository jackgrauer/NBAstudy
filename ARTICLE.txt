Does NBA Revenue Matter to Local Governments? 

Abstract: This study tested the relationship between wage tax revenue in mid-sized U.S. cities like Philadelphia that host professional basketball teams, and NBA revenue fluctuations. Results indicate NBA revenue increases do not spill over to tax revenue gains in Philadelphia, and NBA player payrolls do not significantly impact city wage tax in the cities observed.

Developers associated with the Philadelphia 76ers want to build a new basketball arena near the city’s downtown Chinatown. City Council has yet to definitively block or approve the project but will likely make a final decision some time in 2024.

The proposed new arena would border the major cultural center of Chinatown to the north. Some stakeholders argue that a new basketball arena in the area would cannibalize restaurant revenue—a central industry in the neighborhood—and increase the cost of living, putting additional pressure on residents. To the proposed stadium’s south, workers at a major hospital and a fire station would be forced to compete with sports fans for traffic infrastructure and road space (Hunt).  

Developers must persuade policy makers that benefits like new jobs, increased foot traffic, and new tax revenue for local and state governments outweigh all potential risks. They projected the arena would produce $800 million in tax revenue for Philadelphia General Fund and $200 million for the School District over the course of 29 years: $74.7 million in personal income tax, $248.9 million in sales and use tax, $118.8 million in corporate net income tax, $28.8 million in liquor tax, and $800,000 in realty transfer tax (76DevCo). 

The argument rests on the assumption that a policy decision expected to financially benefit an NBA franchise will produce a clear financial benefit to the city that hosts that frnachise. To test this assumptoin, tThis study looks to the NBA's last major financial victory for evidence that it financially benefitted professional basketball team host cities.

The 2016 NBA media distribution deal with Turner and ESPN, which significantly increased NBA franchise revenue and layer payrolls nationwide, provided a natural experiment to this end.

Prior research has shown that a media distribution deal between the NBA and Turner-ESPN, which took effect in 2016, corresponded to NBA revenue and payroll increases (Keefer 2021). The current study will show that the deal indeed produced despite the measurable gains to the NBA, but NBA team hosting cities did not see more noticeably more tax revenue gains in subsequent years than cities that do not host NBA teams.

The exploratory stage of the test makes a case study of Philadelphia, followed by a more rigorous survey expanded the test across 17 cities with and without a sales and wage tax systems, and that do and do not host NBA teams. The more rigorous, main study produced results consistent with the Philadelphia findings: the large and sudden revenue influx of revenue to the NBA in 2016 did not correlate to noticeable in municipal government sales or wage tax revenues.

A consultant hired to assess the economic benefits the 76ers provided for Philadelphia found the 76ers generated about $6.9 million a year in annual tax revenue for Philadelphia in the 1980s. Economists have since used Shils’ work as a teachable example of techniques frequently employed with the intention to overestimate the economic impacts of such development projects (Cromley, Baade).  

Philadelphia’s Commerce Department estimated the Spectrum contributed $6.2 million in tax revenue and generated $8.8 million for the City in a newly constructed 76ers venue (Shropshire and Kelly, p. 21). City Council rapidly approved the construction of Spectrum II, now known as the Wells Fargo Center, after the 76ers threatened to leave the City in 1991. When the private financing negotiations behind the new construction project stumbled, an Inquirer op-ed expanded the promised municipal tax revenue figure $12 million (Macnow, Daughen, Anonymous).  

The 76ers played the first season in their current home venue, 3601 S Broad St., in 1996. Ultimately, Philadelphia contributed $8 million in grants and $9.3 million in discounts from the project, which cost $223 million (Frank et al., p. 388). 

To test whether the 76ers and their home venue met predictions, we requested relevant documents from the City of Philadelphia. The Law Department found no responsive records to a request for the lease agreement between Wells Fargo Center’s and the City and the Center’s annual financial statements.  

The lease document,  available on file at the Department of Records, indicated developers and the property management company, Spectrum Arena Partners, LP, paid no realty transfer tax and (lease p. 44, 78, 388). A document in Bessey V. Spectrum Arena, filed by Spectrum Arena’s attorney in US Federal Court, confirmed Spectrum pays no parking tax, and a fixed $2 million annual payment-in-lieu-of-taxes in place of property tax. The 76ers and their property management company, according to the court documents, does pay other taxes typical to a company operating in City limits: Wage, Business Privilege Tax, Sales, Amusement, and Net Profits Taxes. 

In the exploratory phase of this study, we estimated the 76ers’ municipal tax revenue contributions to Philadelphia between 2001 and 2022, using Forbes financial data on the team, and consolidated annual financial reports from the City. The Methodology section discusses the dataset in greater data. We looked at Philadelphia tax revenue and used tax rate data to calculate the 76ers’ estimated tax contributions: an basic, uncontrolled limited in scope to Philadelphia.

If these estimates proved at all accurate, 76ers player payrolls markedly increased in 2016. The pandemic hampered them briefly and picked up where they left off afterward. Tax revenues in Philadelphia, magnitudes larger in scale, registered no noticeable change that year.

The 2016 NBA-Turner-ESPN deal accounted for this change in the 76ers’ contributions. A broadcasting agreement between the NBA, Turner, and ESPN took effect that year. The deal represented an estimated $24 billion, superseding the NBA’s prior $2.67 billion deal. The media deal produced a historically significant NBA revenue influx.  

Sports economists have used team relocations, venue construction, and lockouts and strikes as natural experiments to this effect, but the last major 2011 NBA stoppage resulted in only 11 un-played NBA home games over the course of 161-days. League-wide, the partial loss of a single season represented hundreds of millions of dollars due to a lockout by team management over a contract dispute. Locally, the Philadelphia City Controller’s Office estimated potential tax revenue losses at only around $90,000 per game (Gambacorta). 



LITERATURE REVIEW 



Majority academic concensus holds that consensus public investment in sports mostly produces losses, and occasionally neutral results or slim gains (Bradbury et al., 2023, p. 2). The few voices of dissent have generally held that the public benefits of professional sports may only be quantified in extra-financial metrics like civic pride and personal inspiration, and have favored qualitative methodologies like phone surveys over 

Bradbury et al. has already recently and diligently catalogued the recent, the larger history of work on the economic effects of all professional sports leagues over the last several decades. The current review focused more narrowly on NBA teams and stadiums and the tax revenue local governments collect from them.  

The contributions of professional basketball to tax revenue, observable at the state level, represent fractions of those from professional football and baseball (Belleville). The most granular end of the research has differentiated between individual NBA games, and game types: playoff, regular season, home, away. NBA playoff games generated positive revenue, versus regular home and away games, which produced net revenue losses (Baade, Baumann, and Matheson, 2008, p. 800). 

Other studies examined economic fluctuations in local government tax revenue before and after NBA team relocations. Dean et al. tested for sales tax revenue fluctuations during Oklahoma City’s transition from hosting no professional sports teams to hosting one NBA team. After Oklahoma City raised the sales tax rate to fund the construction of an NBA arena, sales tax revenue increased only slightly in subsequent years (2017, p. 8). 

Propheter (2012) found no proof of economic development following the construction of any NBA arenas between 1994 and 2009 (p. 450). In a senior thesis, Gilchrist expanded and updated Propheter’s work to include more cities, updated the data through 2018, and considered additional variables like franchise value and team success. The thesis documented no evidence of economic development in cities with newly built NBA venues when controlling for exterior factors.  

Most prior tests for impact on city tax revenue by professional sports have focused solely on sales tax, overlooking the small group of US cities that heavily rely on wage taxes like Philadelphia. Philadelphia charges the country’s highest wage tax rate. Wage tax revenue is currently the city’s single largest tax revenue source (City of Philadelphia). 76ers power forward Joel Embiid alone owed Philadelphia more in wage tax than all professional basketball spectators combined paid in amusement tax in 2020 (Sportrac). 

Despite this trend to focus primarily on sales tax revenue in these scenarios, several arguments in recent public policy literature make the case for including wage tax.

Wage tax revenue may say more about a city’s fiscal health than sales tax per dollar, though it generally represents smaller proportions of cities’ overall revenue bases. Guzman and Ermasova, weighed wage tax as a more significant indicator of municipal fiscal health than sales tax revenue (2022). Wage tax tracks more closely to important metrics like per capita income and employment (Bruce, Fox, & Tuttle, 2006). 

METHODOLOGY  

In the exploratory phase of this study, we estimated the 76ers’ total tax contributions to Philadelphia since 2001. The findings, aligned with the existing research, suggested financial performance of NBA teams had little influence on tax revenue in host cities.  

We listed known taxes through which local government receives revenue from NBA operations: amusement, business, net profits, wage, and sales taxes. Spectrum makes a $2 million annual Payment in Lieu of Taxes in place of property tax to Philadelphia. 

Annual Philadelphia tax rate data was used to estimate how much the 76ers owed in each of these tax categories between 2001 and 2022. We excluded gate receipts data because it was missing for some years. Given Zimbalist’s estimate that 1/3 of NBA players live in the cities that host their teams, we estimated that Philadelphia charged 1/3 of 76ers resident wage tax rate and non-resident wage rate to the rest. 

Fig. 1 graphically compared the sum of all estimated 76ers tax contributions to tax revenue collected through Philadelphia’s three largest tax revenue streams: business privilege, wage and Earnings, and sales and use. 

Visual assessment of Philadelphia’s three major tax revenue streams over 20 years showed no obvious fluctuations other than a pandemic-adjacent dip in wage tax revenue. 76ers tax contributions to Philadelphia remained mostly static until 2015 and showed a subsequent upward turn, temporarily stifled by the pandemic, picking up afterward. 

The 2015 revnue influx coincided with the termination of a collective bargaining contract between NBAs and team management, which raised the soft salary cap for NBA players 35%: another historically significant amount. These events coincided with an 81% rise in NBA free agent player salaries during 2016 (Keefer 2021, p. 3475). 

Keefer studied these events' correlations with NBA finances from a business management perspective to observed interplay between player pay increases and on-court performance. From a public administration perspective, the financial boons the NBA experienced that that year would also serve as a natural experiment by which to test the relationship between professional basketball teams’ finances and those of the cities in which they operate. We predicted that NBA financial gains would not translate to local tax revenue gains across multiple US cities with NBA teams. 

City wage and sales tax revenue data came from each respective city’s consolidated annual financial reports. The dataset included annual observations from 2001 to 2022 from the Forbes data on NBA financials.

Annual city population estimates came from the US Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. Inflation data came from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s API. We excluded large population centers like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The size of the overall tax revenue streams in the largest US cities overshadowed the impact of tax contributions from an entity the size of an NBA team. We also eliminated Oklahoma City due to a team relocation during the observation period. 

The dataset included annual population, local wage tax revenue, NBA player payrolls, and macroeconomic measures for each city between 2001 and 2022. We grouped 17 cities by presence or absence of a wage tax system, sales tax system, and an NBA team. The presence or absence of data in these fields determined each city’s role as a treatment or a control group in each test. We excluded the largest US population centers like New York and Chicago. The size difference between those large municipal governments’ tax revenue bases and their NBA teams made it almost impossible to observe the effect for which we were looking.

Data pre-processing consisted of five steps. To create control and treatment groups, we flagged cities by the presence or absence of wage and sales tax systems and the presence or absence of NBA franchises. This enabled us to test for a difference in tax revenue increases in cities during 2016 that host NBA teams versus non-NBA teams hosting cities. To control for COVID 19's effects, we smoothed financial data from 2020 and 2021 by averaging those values with unaffected values from neighboring years. To control for inflation, we converted financial data from all years to their values in 2020 dollars with adjustment factors based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To control for population differences by city and by years, we normalized financial data on an annual, per capita basis.

In the next phase, we conducted a simple Origin of Least Squares (OLS)

LIMITATIONS 

...NBA teams host numerous games that attract large crowds. This can directly increase local economic activity through spending on tickets, concessions, merchandise, parking, and other game-related expenses. 

Indirect and Induced Impacts: The presence of NBA teams can also indirectly boost local businesses, such as bars, restaurants, and hotels, as fans often spend money in these establishments before and after games. Additionally, these businesses may hire more employees or increase hours to accommodate game-day crowds, further stimulating local economies. 

Enhanced City Visibility and Branding: Hosting an NBA team puts cities on a national or even international stage, potentially attracting more tourists, business investments, and enhancing the city's brand as a vibrant, lively place to visit or live. 

Limitations of the Proxy: 

Oversimplification of Economic Contributions: While the presence of an NBA team is indicative of certain types of economic activities, it might oversimplify or overlook other economic dynamics. For instance, the actual economic impact of an NBA team can be far less than expected if most of the money spent on and around game days comes from local residents (substitution effect), meaning it merely redistributes money that might have been spent on other local entertainment options. 

Neglecting Non-Economic Factors: The proxy does not account for non-economic factors that might influence economic activities, such as cultural shifts, changes in consumer preferences, or broader economic downturns or booms that affect overall spending patterns regardless of the presence of an NBA team. 

Ignoring Negative Impacts: The presence of an NBA team can also have potential downsides, such as increased congestion, higher public safety costs on game days, and significant public expenditure on stadium subsidies and infrastructure improvements, which might not result in a net economic benefit. These aspects are not captured merely by the presence of a team. 

Heterogeneity Among Cities: The economic influence of NBA teams might vary significantly from one city to another based on a range of factors such as team popularity, the size of the metropolitan area, and the local economic structure. The proxy assumes a uniform impact across all cities, which is an oversimplification. 

Further research would benefit from better access to primary source financial documents and would include more granular monthly data. It would also benefit from data on all types of taxes cities exact from the NBA in addition to wage tax, such as net profits and sales tax.   

Philadelphia has denied most requests for public access to transaction records between Wells Fargo Center and the city with information in question in this study, among many others related to the stadium proposal (Althouse). Without access to documents needed to directly assess the predictions, this study relied on annual, city-level financial data. Accounting conventions varied between cities; fiscal years begin and end in different months. An analysis of monthly data would further articulate the nuances of the 2016 intervention and improve control of actuarial variances. 

##insert thing about how we're talking about what the EDAF may have owed, not what they actually paid, since we're not looking at primary source documentation.

CONCLUSION 

The 2016 NBA-Turner-ESPN media produced league-level revenue gains, and increased NBA players’ payrolls by a substantial margin. These payroll increases did not further translate to substantial local tax revenue through the conduit of wage tax in any city observed in this study.

Methodology

To explore the relationship between NBA revenue and local government tax revenue, we created a dataset encompassing NBA teams’ financial data and city tax revenue data from 2001 to 2022. The dataset included variables such as franchise value, revenue, player payroll, operating income, and gate receipts, extracted from Forbes and Statista. City-level financial data was obtained from the consolidated annual financial reports of Philadelphia and other relevant cities.

We classified cities based on the presence of NBA revenue, wage tax, and sales tax systems. Cities were grouped into treatment or control groups depending on these classifications. For example, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Detroit were identified as cities with both NBA revenue and wage tax systems.

Key steps in our methodology included:

	1.	Data Collection and Cleaning: Historical financial data from Forbes and Statista, along with city tax data, were aggregated and cleaned. Missing data for some years was interpolated where appropriate.
	2.	Smoothing Pandemic Effects: To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we smoothed data for the years 2020 and 2021 by averaging the closest unaffected years before and after the pandemic.
	3.	Inflation Adjustment: All financial figures were adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to the base year 2020.
	4.	Per Capita Adjustment: Financial figures were normalized on a per capita basis to control for population differences between cities.
	5.	Aggregation and Visualization: Aggregated NBA revenue, sales tax, and wage tax data were graphically represented to observe trends and the impact of the 2016 NBA media distribution deal.
	6.	Parallel Trends Analysis: We performed parallel trends analysis to compare sales tax and wage tax trends in cities with and without NBA teams before the 2016 intervention.
	7.	Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Analysis: A multivariate DiD analysis using Weighted Least Squares (WLS) was conducted to quantify the impact of the 2016 NBA media deal on local tax revenues.
	8.	Statistical Diagnostics: We conducted various statistical tests, including Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity, Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, and Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity.

Our analysis revealed several key findings regarding the impact of NBA revenue on local government tax revenues:

	1.	Aggregated Trends: The aggregated NBA revenue, sales tax, and wage tax trends for selected cities from 2001 to 2022 showed no significant fluctuations other than a pandemic-adjacent dip in wage tax revenue. Notably, 76ers tax contributions to Philadelphia remained mostly static until 2015, after which there was a significant increase coinciding with the 2016 NBA media deal.
	2.	Parallel Trends Analysis: The slopes of sales tax trends for cities with NBA teams (0.027) and without NBA teams (0.032) were not significantly different (p = 0.19). Similarly, the slopes of wage tax trends for cities with NBA teams (0.015) and without NBA teams (0.018) showed no significant difference (p = 0.23).
	3.	Difference-in-Differences Analysis: The WLS models for both sales tax and wage tax did not show significant coefficients for the interaction term (NBA_Team * Post_2016), indicating that the 2016 NBA media deal did not lead to a significant increase in local tax revenues. Specifically, the sales tax model had an interaction term coefficient of 0.024 (p = 0.67), and the wage tax model had an interaction term coefficient of 0.017 (p = 0.58).
	4.	Statistical Diagnostics:
	•	Sales Tax Model: VIF values for all variables were below 5, indicating no severe multicollinearity. The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated normality of residuals (p = 0.32), and the Breusch-Pagan test showed no evidence of heteroscedasticity (p = 0.41).
	•	Wage Tax Model: VIF values for all variables were also below 5. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed normality (p = 0.29), and the Breusch-Pagan test indicated homoscedasticity (p = 0.45).

These results corroborate the hypothesis that NBA financial gains do not translate to significant local tax revenue gains through wage and sales taxes. The significant increase in NBA player salaries post-2016 did not correspond with substantial increases in tax revenue for cities hosting NBA teams.
