Does NBA Revenue Matter to Local Governments? 

Abstract: This study tested the relationship between wage tax revenue in mid-sized U.S. cities like Philadelphia that host professional basketball teams, and NBA revenue fluctuations. Results indicate NBA revenue increases do not spill over to tax revenue gains in Philadelphia, and NBA player payrolls do not significantly impact city wage tax in the cities observed.

Developers associated with the Philadelphia 76ers want to build a new basketball arena near the city’s downtown Chinatown. City Council has yet to rule definitively on the project but will likely do so sometime this year.  

Concerns with the proposal include, but do not limit to, the fact that it would border the major cultural center of Chinatown to the north. The arena would force Philadelphia’s Chinatown to compete for dining revenue — a central industry in that neighborhood — and increase the cost of living, forcing residents to compete in that respect. To the proposed stadium’s south, workers at a major hospital and a fire station would be forced to compete with sports fans for traffic infrastructure and road space (Hunt).  

The developers who made the proposal have sought to persuade policymakers that benefits like new jobs, increased foot traffic, and new tax revenue for local and state governments outweigh all risks. They projected the arena would produce $800 million in tax revenue for Philadelphia General Fund and $200 million for the School District over a 29-year lease: $74.7 million in personal income tax, $248.9 million in sales and use tax, $118.8 million in corporate net income tax, $28.8 million in liquor tax, and $800,000 in realty transfer tax (76DevCo). 

The underlying assumption: NBA profits translate to new local tax revenue in cities that host NBA teams. To test that claim, we examined whether the last major revenue increase to the NBA coincided with a revenue influx in local government tax revenue in Philadelphia and other cities.  

The 2016 NBA media distribution deal with Turner and ESPN, which significantly increased player payrolls, provided the most recent historical example of this situation, and an opportune natural experiment. Results corroborated prior research findings the 2016 media deal corresponded to NBA payroll increases (Keefer 2021), but not to a significant rise in wage tax revenue for the NBA team host city of Philadelphia.  

We then expanded the test across 11 cities with and without a wage tax system, and that do and do not host NBA teams, which produced results consistent with the Philadelphia findings: the large and sudden revenue influx of revenue to the NBA in 2016 did not translate to significant revenue increases to local governments. 

A consultant hired to assess the economic benefits the 76ers provided for Philadelphia found the 76ers generated about $6.9 million a year in annual tax revenue for Philadelphia in the 1980s. Economists have since used Shils’ work as a teachable example of how consultants overestimate the predicted economic impacts of such development projects (Cromley, Baade).  

Philadelphia’s Commerce Department estimated the Spectrum contributed $6.2 million in tax revenue and generated $8.8 million for the City in a newly constructed venue (Shropshire and Kelly, p. 21). City Council rapidly approved the construction of Spectrum II, now known as the Wells Fargo Center, after the 76ers threatened to leave the City in 1991. When the private financing negotiations behind the new construction project stumbled, an Inquirer op-ed expanded the promised municipal tax revenue figure $12 million (Macnow, Daughen, Anonymous).  

The 76ers played the first season in their current home venue, 3601 S Broad St., in 1996. Ultimately, Philadelphia contributed $8 million in grants and $9.3 million in discounts from the project, which cost $223 million (Frank et al., p. 388). 

To test whether the 76ers and their home venue met predictions, we requested relevant documents from the City of Philadelphia. The Law Department found no responsive records to a request for the lease agreement between Wells Fargo Center’s and the City and the Center’s annual financial statements.  

The lease document was available on file at the Department of Records. According to that lease, developers paid no realty transfer tax and (lease p. 44, 78, 388). A document in Bessey V. Spectrum Arena, filed by Spectrum Arena’s attorney in US Federal Court, confirmed Spectrum pays no parking tax, and a fixed $2 million annual payment-in-lieu-of-taxes in place of property tax. The 76ers and their property management company, according to the court documents, does pay other taxes typical to a company operating in City limits: Wage, Business Privilege Tax, Sales, Amusement, and Net Profits Taxes. 

We estimated the 76ers’ municipal tax revenue contributions to Philadelphia between 2001 and 2022, using Forbes financial data on the team, and consolidated annual financial reports from the City. The Methodology section discusses the dataset in greater data. We looked at Philadelphia tax revenue and used tax rate data to calculate the 76ers’ estimated tax contributions. This back-of-napkin comparison, without controls, became this study’s exploratory section. 

If these estimates are correct, 76ers tax contributions markedly increased in 2016. The pandemic hampered them briefly and picked up where they left off afterward. Tax revenues in Philadelphia, much larger in scale, registered no noticeable change in 2016. 

The 2016 NBA-Turner-ESPN deal accounted for this change in the 76ers’ contributions. A broadcasting agreement between the NBA, Turner, and ESPN took effect that year. The deal represented an estimated $24 billion, superseding the NBA’s prior $2.67 billion deal. The media deal produced a historically significant NBA revenue influx.  

Sports economists have used team relocations, venue construction, and lockouts and strikes as natural experiments to this effect, but the last major 2011 NBA stoppage resulted in only 11 un-played NBA home games over the course of 161-days. League-wide, the partial loss of a single season represented hundreds of millions of dollars due to a lockout by team management over a contract dispute. Locally, the Philadelphia City Controller’s Office estimated potential tax revenue losses at only around $90,000 per game (Gambacorta). 

The current study focused on local wage tax revenue as a dependent variable. Given the nature of the 2016 intervention we wanted to test, observable effects were most prominent in player payrolls.  

Prior studies have tested NBA venues and teams’ impact on sales tax revenue and found little. Further elaboration on the sales tax revenue aspect of this issue would risk redundancy. 

A focus in the literature solely on sales tax overlooks the small group of US cities that heavily rely on wage taxes, such as Philadelphia. Philadelphia charges the country’s highest wage tax rate, which has in many fiscal years represented the city’s single largest tax revenue source. To illustrate, 76ers power forward Joel Embiid alone owed Philadelphia more in wage tax than all professional basketball spectators combined paid in amusement tax in 2020 (Sportrac). 

Wage tax revenue may say more about a city’s fiscal health than sales tax per dollar, though wage generally represents smaller proportions of cities’ revenue bases (Guzman and Ermasova, 2022). While equally volatile, wage tax tracks more closely and predictably to important metrics like per capita income and employment (Bruce, Fox, & Tuttle, 2006). 

NBA player payrolls have a more direct, controlled connection to wage tax revenue. Philadelphia may collect sales tax from both the 76ers and the Wells Fargo Center from any number of concessions, media, merchandise, luxury services, etc. Sales tax revenue generated by the 76ers, or the Wells Fargo Center come subject to a potentially unlimited number of their own influencing factors. This volatility makes sales tax much more volatile and less predictable for financial analysis without direct access to these organizations’ financial documents. 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

The consensus is that public investment in sports mostly produces losses, and occasionally neutral results or slim gains (Bradbury et al., 2023, p. 2). This recent, comprehensive survey by Bradbury et al., frees the current review to focus on a subsection of studies that involved NBA teams and stadiums and the tax revenue local governments collect from them.  

The contributions of professional basketball to tax revenue, observable at the state level, represent fractions of those from professional football and baseball (Belleville). The most granular end of the research has differentiated results between individual NBA games, and game types: playoff, regular season, home, away. NBA playoff games generated positive revenue, versus regular home and away games, which produced net revenue losses (Baade, Baumann, and Matheson, 2008, p. 800). 

Other studies examined economic fluctuations in local government tax revenue before and after NBA team relocations. Dean et al. tested for sales tax revenue fluctuations during Oklahoma City’s transition from hosting no professional sports teams to hosting one NBA team. After Oklahoma City raised the sales tax rate to fund the construction of an NBA arena, sales tax revenue increased only slightly in subsequent years (2017, p. 8). 

Propheter (2012) found no proof of economic development following the construction of any NBA arenas between 1994 and 2009 (p. 450). In a senior thesis, Gilchrist expanded and updated Propheter’s work to include more cities, updated the data through 2018, and considered additional variables like franchise value and team success. Gilchrist found no evidence of economic development in cities with newly built NBA venues when controlling for exterior factors.  

METHODOLOGY  

In the exploratory phase of this study, we created an informed estimate of the 76ers’ total tax contributions to Philadelphia over the past few decades. Our initial observations, confirmed by a large amount of existing research, let us to believe the financial performance of NBA teams had little influence on tax revenue in host cities.  

We listed known taxes through which local government receives revenue from NBA operations. We based this list on information from federal court documents and the lease agreement between Spectrum Arena LP, the 76ers property manager and the City of Philadelphia, and court documents filed by Spectrum, Spectrum and the 76ers pay amusement, business, net profits, wage, and sales taxes. Spectrum makes a $2 million annual Payment in Lieu of Taxes in place of property tax to Philadelphia. 

Forbes and Statista publish annual financial data on NBA teams: franchise value, revenue, player payroll, operating income and gate receipts between 2001 and 2022. Using historical tax revenue data from the city of Philadelphia, we wrote a script that produced annual estimates of what the 76ers owed in all appropriate taxes. We excluded gate receipts data because it was missing for some years. Given Zimbalist’s estimate that 1/3 of NBA players live in the cities that host their teams, we estimated that Philadelphia charged 1/3 of 76ers resident wage tax rate and non-resident wage rate to the rest. 

Fig. 1 graphically compared the sum of all estimated 76ers tax contributions to tax revenue collected through Philadelphia’s three largest tax revenue streams: business privilege, wage and Earnings, and sales and use. Visual assessment of Philadelphia’s three major tax revenue streams over 20 years showed no obvious fluctuations other than a pandemic-adjacent dip in wage tax revenue. 76ers tax contributions to Philadelphia remained mostly static until 2015 and showed a subsequent upward turn, temporarily stifled by the pandemic, picking up afterward. 

The influx coincided with the termination of a collective bargaining contract between professional basketball players and their management, which raised the soft salary cap for NBA players 35%: another historically significant amount. Together, these factors produced an 81% rise in NBA free agent player salaries during 2016 (Keefer 2021, p. 3475). 

Keefer took interest in 2016’s effect on NBA finances from a business management perspective. They sought to test how the pay increases impacted players’ performance on court. From a public administration perspective, we theorized the financial boons the NBA experienced that that year would also serve as a natural experiment by which to test the relationship between professional basketball teams’ finances and those of the cities in which they operate. 

We predicted that NBA financial gains would not translate to local tax revenue gains across multiple US cities with NBA teams. City wage and sales tax revenue data came from each respective city’s consolidated annual financial reports. The dataset included annual observations from 2001 to 2022 to the observation period of the Forbes data on NBA financials.

Annual city population estimates came from the US Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. Inflation data came from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s API. We excluded large population centers like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The size of the overall tax revenue streams in the largest US cities overshadowed the impact of tax contributions from an entity the size of an NBA team. We also eliminated Oklahoma City due to a team relocation during the observation period. 

The data was smoothed to mitigate the pandemic's effect on NBA and government data by using averages from the closest unaffected years before and after 2020 and 2021. We normalized figures on an annual, per capita basis to control population differences between cities and fluctuations between years. These values were additionally adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), indexed to the base year 2020. 

The dataset of the larger study included yearly population, local wage tax revenue, NBA player payrolls, and macroeconomic measures for each city between 2001 and 2022. We grouped 17 cities by presence or absence of a wage tax system, sales tax system, and an NBA team. The presence or absence of data in these fields determined each city’s role as a treatment or a control group in each test. We excluded the largest US population centers to give the NBA the benefit of the doubt in terms of observable impact. The magnitude of difference between those governments’ tax revenue bases and their NBA teams were too large to exert the effect we wanted to observe.

Diagnostics reflected potential problems in the data with homoscedasticity, non-normality and multicollinearity. We centered the interaction and intervention variables to reduce variance inflation factor (VIF) to acceptable levels and adopted a Robust Linear Model (RLM) with Hampel standard errors to mitigate potential problems caused by heteroscedasticity and non-normality of data.

LIMITATIONS 

NBA teams host numerous games that attract large crowds. This can directly increase local economic activity through spending on tickets, concessions, merchandise, parking, and other game-related expenses. 

Indirect and Induced Impacts: The presence of NBA teams can also indirectly boost local businesses, such as bars, restaurants, and hotels, as fans often spend money in these establishments before and after games. Additionally, these businesses may hire more employees or increase hours to accommodate game-day crowds, further stimulating local economies. 

Enhanced City Visibility and Branding: Hosting an NBA team puts cities on a national or even international stage, potentially attracting more tourists, business investments, and enhancing the city's brand as a vibrant, lively place to visit or live. 

Limitations of the Proxy: 

Oversimplification of Economic Contributions: While the presence of an NBA team is indicative of certain types of economic activities, it might oversimplify or overlook other economic dynamics. For instance, the actual economic impact of an NBA team can be far less than expected if most of the money spent on and around game days comes from local residents (substitution effect), meaning it merely redistributes money that might have been spent on other local entertainment options. 

Neglecting Non-Economic Factors: The proxy does not account for non-economic factors that might influence economic activities, such as cultural shifts, changes in consumer preferences, or broader economic downturns or booms that affect overall spending patterns regardless of the presence of an NBA team. 

Ignoring Negative Impacts: The presence of an NBA team can also have potential downsides, such as increased congestion, higher public safety costs on game days, and significant public expenditure on stadium subsidies and infrastructure improvements, which might not result in a net economic benefit. These aspects are not captured merely by the presence of a team. 

Heterogeneity Among Cities: The economic influence of NBA teams might vary significantly from one city to another based on a range of factors such as team popularity, the size of the metropolitan area, and the local economic structure. The proxy assumes a uniform impact across all cities, which is an oversimplification. 

Further research would benefit from better access to primary source financial documents and would include more granular monthly data. It would also benefit from data on all types of taxes cities exact from the NBA in addition to wage tax, such as net profits and sales tax.   

Philadelphia has denied most requests for public access to transaction records between Wells Fargo Center and the city with information in question in this study, among many others related to the stadium proposal (Althouse). Without access to documents needed to directly assess the predictions, this study relied on annual, city-level financial data. Accounting conventions varied between cities; fiscal years begin and end in different months. An analysis of monthly data would further articulate the nuances of the 2016 intervention and improve control of actuarial variances. 

CONCLUSION 

The 2016 NBA-Turner-ESPN media produced league-level revenue gains, and increased NBA players’ payrolls by a substantial margin. These payroll increases did not further translate to substantial local tax revenue through the conduit of wage tax in any city observed in this study.
